      <description>Hi, I am a Sysadmin since 2005 and a DevOps Engineer since early 2018. I just love to work with IT and to learn about new technologies and frameworks. Currently I am learning more about Python and Go languages to help my devops tasks. I really love to work with Kubernetes, Terraform and Jenkins, btw.
In my free time, I used to play a lot of videogames and watch some series.</description>
